# Coding

Structured restart path for getting back into coding and moving toward web development jobs.

## Start here (in order)
1. `LEARNING_PATH.md` -> full beginner-to-job roadmap with recommended platforms and durations.
2. `WEEK1_PLAN.md` -> exact 7-day schedule (90 min/day, no guesswork).
3. `WEEK1_PROGRESS.md` -> track daily progress.
4. `js/day1_basics.js` -> first coding module and exercises.

## How to use Codex in this repo
Use Codex as your tutor/debug partner while following structured courses (freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, CS50P).
