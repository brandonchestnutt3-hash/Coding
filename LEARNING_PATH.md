# Restart Coding Path (Beginner-Again -> Job-Ready Web Dev)

This is a **real course sequence** with estimated times, exact platforms, and clear outputs.
You do **not** need to figure out "what to do" each day.

---

## 0) Setup (One-time, 60-90 minutes)

### What to install
1. **VS Code** (editor)
2. **Git** (version control)
3. **Node.js LTS** (JavaScript runtime + npm)
4. **Python 3.12+**

### Where to code
- Local machine in VS Code.
- Optional: GitHub Codespaces / Replit if you prefer browser coding.

### Verify in terminal
```bash
node -v
npm -v
python --version
git --version
```

Output goal: all commands return a version.

---

## 1) JavaScript Foundations (2-3 weeks, ~35-45 hours)

### Why first
- Fast feedback in browser + Node.
- Core web dev language.
- Strong hiring value for frontend and full-stack.

### Course sequence (do in this order)
1. **freeCodeCamp - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** (300+ short exercises)
   - Time: ~20-25 hours
   - Learn: variables, functions, loops, arrays, objects, algorithms
2. **The Odin Project - Foundations (JavaScript sections)**
   - Time: ~10-15 hours for core sections
   - Learn: practical workflow, DOM basics, Git/GitHub routine
3. **Practice set in this repo (`js/day1_basics.js`)**
   - Time: 30-45 minutes per session
   - Learn: translating concepts into your own code

### How to study each session (exact)
- 10 min: read/watch one lesson
- 30 min: code along and retype examples yourself
- 20 min: do 2 exercises without looking
- 10 min: write notes (what clicked / what failed)

### End-of-module outcome
You can write small functions from scratch and debug basic logic.

---

## 2) HTML + CSS for Web Basics (1-2 weeks, ~20-30 hours)

### Course sequence
1. **freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design**
   - Time: ~15-20 hours
   - Learn: semantic HTML, CSS layout, responsive design
2. **Frontend Mentor (newbie challenges)**
   - Time: ~5-10 hours
   - Learn: turning designs into real pages

### End-of-module outcome
You can build a clean static landing page and deploy it.

---

## 3) JavaScript in the Browser (2-3 weeks, ~30-40 hours)

### Course sequence
1. **The Odin Project - Full Stack JavaScript (early JS/DOM modules)**
2. **JavaScript.info (sections: Objects, DOM, Events)**

### Build targets
- To-do app
- Calculator
- Weather app (API)

### End-of-module outcome
You can build interactive browser apps using DOM and fetch APIs.

---

## 4) Python Foundations (parallel or after JS, 2-3 weeks, ~30-40 hours)

### Why learn Python too
- Excellent for scripting, automation, backend, and interview prep.

### Course sequence
1. **CS50P (edX) - Introduction to Programming with Python**
   - Time: ~30-40 hours
   - Learn: Python syntax, functions, files, testing basics
2. **Exercism Python track (first 20-30 exercises)**
   - Time: ~10-15 hours

### End-of-module outcome
You can automate simple tasks and solve beginner algorithm problems in Python.

---

## 5) Web Development Job Path (6-10 weeks project phase)

### Stack target
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (core)
- React (frontend framework)
- Node/Express (backend basics)
- SQL (database basics)

### Project roadmap
1. Portfolio site
2. To-do app with persistence
3. Notes app with auth (stretch)
4. One API project (e.g., weather/dashboard)

### Job-ready signals
- 3-4 deployed projects
- GitHub with clean READMEs
- Consistent commit history
- Basic testing habits

---

## Recommended Platforms (best for structure)

1. **freeCodeCamp** (best free, step-by-step, beginner safe)
2. **The Odin Project** (best project-based web roadmap)
3. **CS50x / CS50P** (best structured university-style instruction)
4. **Frontend Mentor** (best for practical frontend reps)
5. **Exercism** (best short coding drills + mentorship)
6. **Codecademy / Scrimba** (paid/freemium, very guided interactive learning)

If you feel overwhelmed, start with only:
- freeCodeCamp JS + Responsive Web Design
- this repo practice files

---

## Daily Plan Template (90 minutes)

- **Block 1 (25 min):** Lesson/video
- **Block 2 (35 min):** Code-along + retype from memory
- **Block 3 (20 min):** 1-2 independent exercises
- **Block 4 (10 min):** Log progress in `WEEK1_PROGRESS.md`

Use a timer. Stop when block ends. This prevents burnout.

## What Codex can do for you (realistically)

Codex is best as your:
- personal tutor for "explain this line-by-line"
- exercise generator with graded hints
- debugging partner
- study planner/tracker
- mock interviewer

Codex is **not** a full video course platform by itself.
Best results: pair Codex + structured external course.
