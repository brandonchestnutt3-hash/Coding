# Week 1 Plan

## How to Start (Today)
Use this exact sequence so you can begin immediately:

1. **Open this repo and create a working branch**
   - `git checkout -b week1/day1-setup`
2. **Set your daily timer for 60–90 minutes**
   - 10 min planning
   - 40–60 min focused coding
   - 10–20 min review + notes
3. **Pick ONE task from Day 1 only** and finish it before moving on.
4. **Commit once the task works**
   - Example: `git commit -m "day1: verify git setup and baseline docs"`
5. **Write a 3-line daily log** in your notes (or `DAILY_LOG.md` if you create it):
   - What I planned
   - What I finished
   - What is next

---

## Week Goal
Finish **at least one small but complete coding milestone** by the end of the week with clear documentation and a clean commit history.

---

## Daily Workflow (Repeat Each Day)

### 1) Plan (10 min)
- Choose your top 1–2 tasks for today.
- Define "done" in one sentence for each task.

### 2) Build (40–60 min)
- Work in small steps.
- Test after meaningful changes.
- If blocked for >20 min, write the blocker and switch to a smaller sub-task.

### 3) Review (10–20 min)
- Confirm task is complete.
- Commit with a descriptive message.
- Update docs/notes with what changed.

## Day-by-Day Tasks

## Day 1 — Repository & Environment Setup
**Outcome:** your repo and tools are ready, and you can start coding without friction.

### Tasks
- [ ] Confirm repository structure and baseline docs (`README.md`, `WEEK1_PLAN.md`).
- [ ] Verify Git setup:
  - [ ] `git config --get user.name`
  - [ ] `git config --get user.email`
  - [ ] `git remote -v`
- [ ] Decide your branch workflow (e.g., one branch per day/task).
- [ ] Make one small setup commit.

### Definition of Done
- You can create a branch, commit, and push without errors.

---

## Day 2 — Project Scoping
**Outcome:** you know exactly what you are building this week.

### Tasks
- [ ] Pick 1–2 core project ideas.
- [ ] For each idea, write:
  - [ ] Problem statement (1–2 lines)
  - [ ] Success criteria (measurable)
  - [ ] MVP scope (what you will build this week)
- [ ] Break MVP into 3–5 small tasks.

### Definition of Done
- One prioritized MVP task list exists and is realistic for this week.

---

## Day 3 — Implementation Sprint 1
**Outcome:** first meaningful piece of the MVP is working.

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement Task 1 from your MVP list.
- [ ] Run basic checks/tests.
- [ ] Commit progress in small increments.

### Definition of Done
- A visible part of the project works end-to-end (even if minimal).

---

## Day 4 — Implementation Sprint 2
**Outcome:** core MVP functionality is mostly complete.

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement remaining core tasks.
- [ ] Refactor rough code for readability.
- [ ] Update usage/setup notes.

### Definition of Done
- MVP features are complete enough for someone else to run and understand.

---

## Day 5 — Validation & Polish
**Outcome:** project is stable and cleaner.

### Tasks
- [ ] Run final checks/tests.
- [ ] Fix bugs and edge cases.
- [ ] Improve error messages and basic UX/output clarity.

### Definition of Done
- Known bugs are handled or documented, and project behaves consistently.

---

## Day 6 — Review & Retrospective
**Outcome:** you understand what went well and what to improve.

### Tasks
- [ ] Compare completed work against success criteria.
- [ ] List blockers and lessons learned.
- [ ] Write 3 improvement actions for next week.

### Definition of Done
- Retrospective notes are written and actionable.

---

## Day 7 — Week 2 Preparation
**Outcome:** next week starts with clarity.

### Tasks
- [ ] Create/prioritize Week 2 backlog.
- [ ] Select top goals for Week 2.
- [ ] Ensure repo/docs are clean and up to date.

### Definition of Done
- Week 2 has a clear first task ready to start.

---

## Deliverables
- `WEEK1_PLAN.md` (this action plan)
- Updated `README.md` and/or project notes as needed
- At least one completed coding milestone by week end
- Optional: `DAILY_LOG.md` with 3-line daily updates

## Success Criteria
- Daily progress tracked (even briefly)
- Clean commit history with descriptive messages
- Completed MVP milestone + documented next steps

---

## Quick Start Checklist (Copy/Paste)
- [ ] Create branch
- [ ] Choose one Day 1 task
- [ ] Finish task fully
- [ ] Commit changes
- [ ] Write 3-line daily log
- [ ] Plan first Day 2 scoping task
